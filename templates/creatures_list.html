                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The common buzzard is a medium-sized raptor. Most buzzards are distinctly round 
                    headed with a somewhat slender bill, relatively 
                    long wings that either reach or fall slightly short of the tail tip when perched, 
                    a fairly short tail, and somewhat short and mainly bare tarsi.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The common buzzard measures between 40 and 58 cm in length with a 109–140 cm wingspan.
                    The flight feathers on perched European buzzards are always brown.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">Usually the tail 
                    will usually be narrowly barred grey-brown and dark brown with a pale tip and a broad 
                    dark subterminal band.</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The main call of the species is a plaintive, far-carrying pee-yow or peee-oo, used 
                    as both contact call and more excitedly in aerial displays. </p>

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The golden eagle is a very large raptor, 66 to 102 centimetres in length. 
                    Its wings are broad and the wingspan is 1.8 to 2.34 metres.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">Adults of both sexes have similar plumage and are primarily dark brown, with some grey on 
                    the inner wing and tail, and a paler, typically golden colour on the back of the crown and 
                    nape that gives the species its common name.</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The voice of the golden eagle is considered weak, high, and shrill, has been called "quite 
                    pathetic" and "puppy-like".</p>
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">Most known vocalisations seem to function as contact calls between eagles, 
                    sometimes adults to their offspring, occasionally territorial birds to intruders and rarely 
                    between a breeding pair.</p>

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The barn owl is a medium-sized, pale-coloured owl with long wings and a short, 
                    squarish tail. A typical specimen measuring about 33 to 39 cm in overall length.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">Barn owls have a typical wingspan of some 80 to 95 cm.</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The shape of the tail is a means of distinguishing the barn owl from typical
                    owls when seen in the air. Other distinguishing features are the undulating flight 
                    pattern and the dangling, feathered legs.</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The pale face with its heart shape and 
                    black eyes give the flying bird a distinctive appearance, the ridge of feathers above the beak somewhat 
                    resembling a nose.</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">It instead produces a shree scream in an eerie, long-drawn-out shriek.</p>

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">Common kestrels measure 32–39 cm from head to tail, with a wingspan of 
                    65–82 cm. They are thus small compared with other birds of prey, but larger 
                    than most songbirds. Like the other Falco species, they have long wings as 
                    well as a distinctive long tail.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">Their plumage is mainly light chestnut brown with blackish spots on the upper 
                    side and buff with narrow blackish streaks on the underside; the remiges are also 
                    blackish. Unlike most raptors, they display sexual colour dimorphism with the
                    male having fewer black spots and streaks, as well as a blue-grey cap and tail. </p>
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures"> 
                    The tail is brown with black bars in females, and has a black tip with a narrow 
                    white rim in both sexes. All common kestrels have a prominent black malar stripe 
                    like their closest relatives.</p>

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The peregrine falcon is a medium-sized raptor with a body length of 34 to 58 cm 
                    and a wingspan from 74 to 120 cm. The male and female have similar markings and 
                    plumage, but as in many birds of prey the peregrine falcon displays marked sexual 
                    dimorphism in size, with the female measuring up to 30% larger than the male. 
                    Males weigh 330 to 1,000 g (0.73–2.20 lb) and the noticeably larger females weigh 
                    700 to 1,500 g (1.5–3.3 lb).</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The back and the long pointed wings of the adult are usually bluish black to slate 
                    grey with indistinct darker barring (see "Subspecies" below); the wingtips are black. 
                    The white to rusty underparts are barred with thin clean bands of dark brown or black. 
                    The tail, coloured like the back but with thin clean bars, is long, narrow, and rounded 
                    at the end with a black tip and a white band at the very end.</p>

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The tawny owl is a robust bird, 37–46 cm in length, with an 81–105 cm wingspan. 
                    Its large rounded head lacks ear tufts, and the facial disc surrounding the dark 
                    brown eyes is usually rather plain.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The flight of the tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at take-off. 
                    As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper 
                    surfaces and a fringe on the leading edge of the outer primaries.</p>

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The call is easily imitated

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">It is an elegant bird, soaring on long wings held at a dihedral, and long forked tail,

                    heavily streaked with black to reddish brown.</p>

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The common pipistrelle is a very small species of bat. Its forearm is 27.7–32.2 mm long. It has a short muzzle.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">It is 3.5–5.2 cm long along the head-and-body, with the tail adding 2.3–3.6 cm. The body mass can range from 3.5 
                    to 8.5 g with the wingspan ranging from 18 to 25 cm. Its brown fur is variable in tone.</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">It is common in woodland and farmland but is also found in towns, where the females roost in lofts and buildings when rearing young.</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The common pipistrelle is an edge specialist, preferring to forage along woodland edges and along isolated tree lines. 
                    It is insectivorous, preying on flies, caddisflies, lacewings, and mayflies.</p>

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">It has long fur relative to its body size. The fur on its back is pale brown with a 
                    golden sheen, while the fur on its ventral side is paler gray, sometimes with a yellowish tinge.
                    Its tragus is narrow and pointed.</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">During the winter, Brandt's bat will roost in mine shafts, caves, tunnels, and cellars. Some,

                    The short fur is dark brown after molting in June (males) or July/August (females), 
                    later it changes to red-brown before the onset of winter. When awake, the body 
                    temperature is 36.5 °C but decreases significantly during inactivity of the animal.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The body mass of adult N. noctula is 25-30 g and they have a wingspan of 37–40 cm. 
                    The species forages with a rapid flying speed of 20–40 km/h, sometimes up to 60 km/h.</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">Because of temporally limited availability of insect prey, they have short daily 
                    activity periods before sunrise and after sunset of in total 1 h or less and must

                    It has a length of 48 to 68 mm (head and body) and a wingspan of 260 to 330 mm. 
                    The forearm measures 38 to 47 mm and the bat's weight is 11 to 20 grams.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The face, ears and wings are dark. The fur is brown, darker at the base than the 
                    tip unlike that of the common noctule which is the same colour along its length. 
                    The undersides of the arms are hairy giving it the alternative name "hairy-armed bat".</p>
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">It is typically found in forests, both coniferous and deciduous, but has also adapted to 
                    parkland and urban areas and frequently roosts in buildings. They like woodland and

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">They can live for up to 12 years. In summer, for all populations of mountain hares, the coat 
                    is various shades of brown. In preparation for winter most populations moult into a white (or

                    short, powerful forelimbs with large paws adapted for digging.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">Moles are known pests to human activities such as agriculture, lawn care, and gardening. 
                    However, they do not eat plant roots; they only cause damage indirectly as they eat 
                    earthworms and other small invertebrates in the soil.</p>
                
                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">Moles are found across most of mainland Scotland and on a few islands including Skye and 
                    Mull. Moles are able to adapt to agricultural land, where you are more likely to see molehills. 
                    They also occur in Scotland in low densities in coniferous forests, moorland and sand dune systems.</p>

                    <p class="modal-text-creatures">The red squirrel, like most tree squirrels, has sharp, curved claws to enable it to climb and descend
