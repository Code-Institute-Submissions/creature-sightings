                    <h4>The Black Isle</h4>
                    <p>Despite its name, the Black Isle is not an island but a peninsula, surrounded on three 
                    sides by the sea â€“ the Cromarty Firth to the north, the Beauly Firth to the south, 
                    and the Moray Firth to the east. The area is home to a population of Bottlenose dolphins. 
                    On the fourth, western side, its boundary is broadly delineated by rivers. The River Conon 
                    divides Maryburgh from Conon Bridge, which is the first village on the Black Isle from 
                    the north-west. Its southwestern boundary is variously considered to be marked by either 
                    a minor tributary of the River Beauly separating Beauly (in Inverness-shire) and Muir of 
                    Ord (on the Black Isle in Ross and Cromarty), dividing the two counties and also 
                    delineating the start of the Black Isle; or alternatively, the River Beauly itself, 
                    thus including Beauly in the Black Isle despite its official placement in Inverness-shire</p>
